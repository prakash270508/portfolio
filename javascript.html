    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><b>JavaScript</b> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
        technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on
        the client side for webpage behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers
        have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14]
        It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
        interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
        Object Model (DOM).
        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
        facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a
        variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages
        are distinct and differ greatly in design.

        <b>Creation at Netscape</b>
        The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical
        people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[15] The lead developers of
        Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in
        1994. This quickly became the most-used.[16][17]
        During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic
        behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene
        to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued
        two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while
        also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]
        Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar
        to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its
        interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September
        1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][18]
        The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the
        time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a
        marketing ploy by Netscape.[19]

        <b>Adoption by Microsoft</b>
        Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front,
        Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript.[20]
        JScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these
        implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Navigator.[21][22] These differences made it
        difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of "best
        viewed in Netscape" and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.[21][23]</p>
